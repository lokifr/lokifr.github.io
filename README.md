I started a website to count down to the next board exams, along with a timetable to help students stay on track. 
It was just a small project, but to my surprise, it became quite popular among my schoolmates from different streams.
Later, I repurposed the website for something way more exciting the countdown to One Piece Gear 5â€™s release.
Eventually, I stopped running the website, but looking back, it was a fun experience.
